    coverContent: 'Phuktal is an ancient Buddhist monastic settlement nestled in the Zanskar ranges of Northern India. It is an example of the development of an isolated human settlement in response to the geology and human ingenuity in construction using earth as the raw material. The architecture of the settlement performatively explores the very nature of the existing landscape, maintaining a type of conditional isolation, acting as an important agent which shapes the community. Here the architecture does not metabolize its landscape, but landscape acts like a machine that makes environments.  The initial stages of construction of the structure dates back to a thousand years, when it started inside a cave, gradually developing over time. Landscape, extreme climate, and isolation are the key elements shaping this monastic community. These elements were not only important in determining the geometry of the structure but also played an important role in defining the use of materials.  High amounts of snow and rainfall made it essential to use materials like Stone and Mud. Since pure mud is not suitable for such harsh climatic conditions, the main foundation of the complex is made of decreasing sizes of stone and the walls are then built with adobe blocks. This gradient allows for random voids which absorbs any tremors by constantly settling, in order to achieve stability. The undressed stones along with the inward gradient in the foundation helps in added stability by maintaining an angle of repose. This angle of repose in relation to the scale of the foundations allows for an added space in the lower section of the houses as a basement level. The natural feature that has helped this construction withstand even more, is the shallow reach of the hard strata. This helps in minimizing vibrations by acting as a shock absorber. This complex amalgamation of the natural terrain and construction technique,  gives a visual appearance as if they were carved out if the cliff face. The geometry of the monastery developed organically over time makes it a challenge to establish connections between different structures. The pathways connecting the structures are very steep. Thus to make them safer, there are various construction techniques adapted. A stone base on the outer periphery of the pathway has been constructed in order to make the pathway strong, avoiding the top strata from losing grip. This is done using a technique called pitching. This monastery has always been a source of ancient Buddhist history since the arrival of the Buddhist culture from Tibet into India. Today this complex stands as a Buddhist monastery which is visited by many tourists every year and is an example of earth architecture that has been ongoing since over 1000 years. This research compiles an architectural analysis of the settlement by trying to understand the different factors determining the development of the place. The report includes a set of conservation documents of the historic place undertaken by a team of students as a means to understand the place.',

The plurality of its usage over different regions, conditions ingeneous techniques man has devised to exploit the material is proof of the feats which can de accomplished by the versitality of the material coupled with man\'s skill. Earth cannot be de termed as a singular material in architecture. It is better described as several complimenting materials, each fulfilling the shortcomings of the other. It is astonishing to see the way the earth has been moulded and crafted in different conditions and situations. One such example is the phukÑ‚al gonpa in the zanskar valley, ladakh.'

Initiated by a construction of a monastery in the 12th century a.D, which sought a comfortable shelter from the harsh elements in the niche of the cave, the site grew organically, to complement the monastery, and devising innovative techniques and methods to enable them to establish a flourishing community, on the near-vertical phase of the hill. It has adapted a building style they could develop with the only easily available material to them- earth, and adapted to it develop structurally sound structures on the highly undulating terrain. It was the locals firm belief, which fueled them to undertake the establishment of process a vertical community, and in the they crafted techniques to sustain their style of architecture, which has remained intact for thousands of years.'
